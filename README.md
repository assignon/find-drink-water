Find drink water is an existing android appliccation that we have recently renewed, from the design to the functionality.
The application consisted of wholesale to easily find drinking water points throughout Amsterdam and uses
the google map to indicate the location of the water points to the users.

The brain's functioning system is found in: nl.dynamicStories.drinkWater / www / js / mapApp.js
the utilities can be found in: nl.dynamicStories.drinkWater / www / js / mapUtils.js
the animations: nl.dynamicStories.drinkWater / www / js / domManipuation.js
the data with which they have worked: nl.dynamicStories.drinkWater / www / js / mapApp.js / waterPuntenData.json
